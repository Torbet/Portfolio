# 2: JUST START

Date: Feb 5, 2021

> The best time to plant a tree was twenty years ago. The second best time is now.

No, the second best time was 19 years and 364 days ago - but I get what you mean.

You read all these stories of the early investors in bitcoin, racking in their millions today, the tech billionaires who got the jump on the competition. Its easy to make yourself believe that you have missed the opportunity for greatness, but in todays climate, that could not be further from the truth

Whatever you want to do in life, the best time to start is now. Waiting for the perfect opportunity or for confirmation that your idea is good will lead to a paralysing state of inaction. You don’t need validation for your idea to get started. Just get to work, see how you feel about, and keep going if it feels good.

My instinct is to feel that I should give readers scientific, solid, evidence-based content. Why would anyone care about me and my opinion?

## The Flywheel

This is one of my favourite concepts that I've learned recently.

It's human nature to look at a successful person or business, and think of a thousand ways in which they could grow their audience / revenue, many of which are easy to implement for them. However - when it comes to going from something to nothing, the idea of growth seems far more aloof.  

If you’ve studied chemistry, you’ll know about activation energy - the ‘hump’ of energy required to get a reaction started. It’s the same in real life - if we want to get anything done, we need to first put in a burst of activation energy to begin with, and then things become a lot easier.

to overcome activation energy, you can force yourself to start. Everything takes care of itself after that.
